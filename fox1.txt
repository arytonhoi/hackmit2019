In August 2014, the city of Flint began a saga to act on a 2012 plan to switch its water source over to Lake Huron. What ensues is a rundown of the pollutants that come with industrial societies. We begin with fecal coliform bacteria, followed by massive influx of chlorine to flush that out: enough to cause corrosion in the engines being built by General Motors. Then we have E. Coli, followed by warnings over excessive amounts of disinfectants and their byproducts. This includes a chlorine byproduct, TTHM, a cancer-causing compound. Fear not, the Governor decides this isnâ€™t an immediate health emergency since the impacts of TTHM takes years to compound and form.
